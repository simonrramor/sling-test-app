# Feedback Mode - User Guide

Send feedback directly to the team from anywhere in the app. Your feedback includes a screenshot with your selection highlighted, making it easy to communicate exactly what you're referring to.

## How to Activate Feedback Mode

**Flip your phone** to enter feedback mode:

1. Hold your phone normally with the screen facing you
2. Tilt the phone forward so the screen faces **down** (away from you)
3. Bring it back **upright** so the screen faces you again

You'll feel a haptic tap and the feedback intro screen will appear.

> **Note:** This gesture requires a real device with motion sensors - it won't work in the simulator.

## Getting Started

When feedback mode activates, you'll see an intro screen explaining the feature. Tap **"Give feedback"** to start drawing your selection, or **"Cancel"** to exit.

## Drawing a Selection

Once you tap "Give feedback":

1. **Touch and hold** anywhere on the screen
2. A **blue circle** will appear around your finger and shrink inward
3. When the circle completes (you'll feel a haptic tap), you can start drawing
4. **Drag your finger** to draw a box around the area you want to highlight
5. **Release** to capture the screenshot

The screenshot will include your selection box with rounded corners, making it clear exactly what part of the screen you're referring to.

## Submitting Your Feedback

After capturing a selection, a feedback form will appear:

### 1. Screenshot Preview
You'll see a thumbnail of your captured screenshot with the selection highlighted.

### 2. Write Your Feedback
Describe what you'd like to report or suggest. Be as specific as possible:
- What's the issue?
- What did you expect to happen?
- Any other relevant details

### 3. Select a Team

Choose who should receive this feedback:

| Team | Recipient | When to Use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Product** | Greg | Feature requests, user experience suggestions, general product feedback |
| **Design** | Simon | Visual issues, UI improvements, design inconsistencies |
| **Dev → Front End** | Marius | App bugs, UI glitches, animation issues, layout problems |
| **Dev → Back End** | Dom | Data issues, API problems, sync issues, performance |

### 4. Submit

## What Happens Next?

Your feedback is automatically:

1. **Created as a Linear ticket** in the Product Engineering team
2. **Assigned** to the appropriate team member
3. **Includes your screenshot** with the highlighted area
4. **Contains your description** and submission details

The assigned team member will receive a notification and can follow up if needed.

## Cancelling Feedback

- While in selection mode: Tap the **Cancel** button at the bottom
- While in the feedback form: Tap **Cancel** in the top left
- To exit without doing anything: Simply don't complete the selection (lift your finger before dragging)

## Tips for Great Feedback

1. **Be specific** - Draw your selection tightly around the exact element you're referring to
2. **One issue at a time** - Submit separate feedback for different issues
3. **Include context** - Mention what you were doing when you noticed the issue
4. **Suggest solutions** - If you have ideas for improvement, include them!
5. **Quick access** - The flip gesture works from anywhere in the app, so you can capture feedback the moment you notice something
